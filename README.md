# Warden::Ldap

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/renewablefunding/warden-ldap.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/renewablefunding/warden-ldap)

**NOTE**: This product is still pre-release, and implementation is *not* in sync with documentation yet - hence the pre-release version.  We'll follow [the Semantic Versioning Specification (Semver)](http://semver.org/), so you can assume anything at 0.x.x still has an unstable API.  But we *are* actively developing this.

Adds LDAP Strategy for [warden](https://github.com/wardencommunity/warden) using the [net-ldap](https://github.com/ruby-ldap/ruby-net-ldap) library.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'warden-ldap'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install warden-ldap

## Usage

1. Install gem per instructions above
2. Initialize the `Warden::Ldap` adapter:

```ruby
Warden::Ldap.configure do |c|
  c.config_file = '/absolute/path/to/config/ldap_config.yml'
  c.env = 'test'
end
```

3. Add the `ldap_config.yml` to configure connection to ldap server. See `lib/fixtures/ldap_config_sample.yml`.

Note: an optional configuration, `test_environments`, accepts an array of environments to mock, where authentication works as long as username and password are supplies and password is not "fail".
